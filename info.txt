Sugestoes:

[ ] animação mão pra tras
[ ] add spikes during chase
[ ] nas ocorrências, automaticamente designar viaturas perto do local, sem precisar chamar reforços
[ ] chamar bombeiros se houver uma explosão dos veículos e junto vim os dois caminhões do jogo e mais o veículo 
[ ] mudar mensagem da ocorrencia pra deixar claro q esta pedindo reforço
[ ] suspeito entrou no carro não pode sair mais
[ ] NPC deve ir no banco de trás.
[ ] quando for levar o npc pra dp, fazer ele entrar no carro primeiro, permitindo q o jogador entre depois
[ ] descer do carro ao chegar na DP
